# What is StarkNet, and what technologies does it leverage for scalability, privacy and security?

StarkNet is a powerful, permissionless Layer 2 network that is designed to enhance Ethereum's capabilities. It uses the power of zk-STARKs technology for scalability, privacy and security. zk-STARKs stand for Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent ARguments of Knowledge. They are a cryptographic proof system that allows for the verification of computations without the need to execute them.
