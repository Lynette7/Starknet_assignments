# How does StarkNet function as a Layer-2 scalability solution for Ethereum, and what cryptographic systems does it use to reduce computation costs?

StarkNet functions as a Layer-2 scalability solution for Ethereum by getting rid of the need for every participant of the network to verify all user interactions. Soonly one node called the prover executes the programs and generates proofs that the computations were done correctly.
In order to reduce the computation costs, the proofs generated are verified by an Ethereum smart contract instead of executingthe interactions themselves.
